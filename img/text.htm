Terminator: Salvation


<p><img src="img/terminator4.jpg" title="Obligatory lazy caption" />SCENE: A terrible wasteland. We see all sorts of awful carnage like doll's heads 
and skulls and stuff like that. It's pretty awful; looks a bit like Bolton town 
centre on a Sunday morning only with more robots. Yes, there are robots; Terminators
walking around, including one with 3 legs, and one that looks like Thom Yorke</p>

<p><strong>John Conner: [voiceover]</strong>: I am John Conner. The year is 2020.
There was a terrible nuclear war, and everyone died. Except me, John Conner, and
my girlfriend, who was Claire Danes, but no longer is. Oh and some other people. 
This place is rubbish. There are robots everywhere.</p>
<p>I am the leader of the resistance and just generally horrible.</p>
<P>In an awkward time-travel related twist, I have accidentally just got off with
my Dad's sister.</P> 


<p> SCENE: The secret base, John's bunk.</p>
<p><strong>John:</strong> You mean Kyle Reese is your brother?
<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Yes, he is. He's a good fighter, isn't he?
<p><strong>John:</strong> Yeah, he's always fighting. So, er, listen. I just realised
we can't continue this relationship.
<p><strong>Susan:</strong> But why not? We have so much in common; we both hate robots
 and love the films of Woody Allen.
<p><strong>John:</strong> I know, but all those things I said last night, that was
before I knew who your brother was.
<p><strong>Susan:</strong> What's wrong with him?
<p><strong>John:</strong> Nothing, er, I mean, er, we're such good friends.
<p><strong>Susan:</strong> No you aren't. He says you keep following him around. He
 thinks you might be gay.
<p><strong>John:</strong> Yes. I mean no, no I don't. And I'm not. Look, okay, it's because I hate
 you.
<p><strong>Susan:</strong> What? You just used me! 
<p><strong>John:</strong> Yes. I am leader of the Resistance, and as such I can do
 such things.

<p>Later</p>
<p><strong>Kyle:</strong> Listen, John, did you upset my sister?
<p><strong>John:</strong> No, what's she been saying? I definitely didn't fall in love
 with my Aunt.
<p><strong>Kyle:</strong> What? No, she's saying you said horrible things.
<p><strong>John:</strong> Yes, I'm a horrible person. Have you heard any more about that
 time machine?
<p><strong>Kyle:</strong> No. Why do you keep talking about time machines?
 
<p><strong>John:</strong> You can't go on any suicide missions unless there's a time
 machine, that's all.
<p><strong>Kyle:</strong> I don't get it. I want to kill robots.
<p><strong>John:</strong> I, er, heard they were making a time machine, and I reckon
you'd be really good at blowing one up, that's all. Look at this picture of my Mom, Kyle. She's pretty hot
isn't she?
<p><strong>Kyle:</strong> Huh? I suppose. Isn't a bit of an odd thing to ask?
<p><strong>John:</strong> Not really. Just wondering if you fancy my Mom that's all
<p><strong>Kyle:</strong> Well, er, she's er, she's dead isn't she? 
<p><strong>John:</strong> I bet she'd fancy you.
<p><strong>Kyle:</strong> Just leave it, John, you're being really weird. 
<p><strong>John:</strong> Well, just keep this photo, yeah.
<p><strong>Kyle:</strong> If it keeps you quiet.
<p><strong>John:</strong> 1984. That's when that was taken. 1984. Time machine. 1984. 
Time. Machine.
